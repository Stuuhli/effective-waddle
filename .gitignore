# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
# Pipfile.lock

# UV
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include uv.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
# uv.lock

# Visual Studio Code
#   Visual Studio Code specific template is maintained in a separate VisualStudioCode.gitignore 
#   that can be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/VisualStudioCode.gitignore
#   and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file. However, if you prefer, 
#   you could uncomment the following to ignore the entire vscode folder
